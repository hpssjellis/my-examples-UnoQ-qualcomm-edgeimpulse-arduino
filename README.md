Started Oct 24, 2025

I am trying to decide if I should make a maker100 Course based on the UnoQ. My curriculum is [here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100-curriculum) and the PortentaH7 Original Maker100 Course is [here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100)

This page as a website if github scares you [here](https://hpssjellis.github.io/my-examples-UnoQ-qualcomm-edgeimpulse-arduino/)

Before making a Robotics IoT Machine learning High School course on the new Arduino UnoQ I typically make an example page where I try out some
code and see what I think of the board.

It has the Arduino App Lab installed for on board work, or you can install the app-lab IDE on your computer at https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/#app-lab-section

And to code just the STM32u585 using the Arduino either the old or new IDE you strangely need to put in the preferences the line of comma seperaated  


```https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/main/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json```

If curious the varieant is suppossed to be the ```STM32U585AII6Q``` 


This might be a good starting point for my viewers.

## Image of both sides of the UnoQ

### Note The Pins are different on the front and the back and even some rows of pins are 1.8V not 3.3V which is great but concerning about power levels?

## Reflashing the board

Hopefully we never have to blank the board but if we do there is a process
